So I decided to code a little plugin for Google Chrome to make it look a bit prettier.
Took about 6 hours as the page was so old that it was done with no CSS or XHTML whatsoever; tables and in-line formatting all the way. Still, with the help of jQuery’s traversing functions I was able to overhaul it quite easily."/>

<p>Took about 6 hours as the page was so <em>old</em> that it was done with no CSS or XHTML whatsoever; tables and in-line formatting all the way. Still, with the help of jQuery’s traversing functions I was able to overhaul it quite easily.<br />
 I even went so far as to extract the URLs of the navbar (along with their titles) and completely replace the <table> setup with an alphabetised <ul> setup (before, the order changed from page to page, making navigation a case of hunting through the nav-bar for the link you wanted).</p>

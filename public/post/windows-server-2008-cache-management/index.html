<h1 id="or-how-explorer-exe-used-all-my-server-s-ram-and-caused-it-to-die">Or, “How explorer.exe used all my server’s RAM and caused it to die”</h1>

<p>One of my clients was experiencing slowdown of their AD server due to explorer.exe consuming 100% of the RAM.</p>

<p>I say slowdown, with that sort of RAM usage the thing ground to a halt and had to either be restarted or have explorer.exe killed (if we were lucky enough to be able to get to the task manager).</p>

<p>After much Googling (and the deadend that was the ‘Disable Search Files Option’ fix) I eventually found this:</p>

<p><strong>KB 976618: <a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/976618">You experience performance issues in applications and services when the system file cache consumes most of the physical RAM</a></strong></p>

<p>through <a href="http://social.technet.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/windowsserver2008r2general/thread/74c2c9ca-f8c1-4c37-bc8c-cd074ce0c6cd" title="2008 R2 Memory Caching">this technet thread</a>.</p>

<p>The KB article basically boils down to “Windows will use all your ram, then fall over” and their solution is “Install this series of .reg files and install a service we should have included in the first place”.</p>

<p>Thanks for that MS, you might have put it in an automatic update…</p>

<p>There’s a <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/ntdebugging/archive/2007/11/27/too-much-cache.aspx">blog post</a> about this issue (specifically mentioning its likely prevalence in x64 systems) from <em>2007</em>!</p>

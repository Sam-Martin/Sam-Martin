      <p>The other day some of my users complained of a very strange issue when using Gmail at work. When composing a new email, they could not upload attachments using the “Advanced Upload” function. When they clicked “Add File” to upload a new document, nothing happened, no error, nothing, it just sat there and refused to work.</p>

<p>Naturally it worked *fine* when I tried it. It seemed to happen only when the user did not have administrative access on their computer. Odd, I thought.<br />
 A quick search of the web <a href="http://www.google.com/support/forum/p/gmail/thread?tid=3396cd44832f693d&amp;hl=en">revealed</a> <a href="http://www.google.com/support/forum/p/gmail/thread?tid=7f77c144096a5903&amp;hl=en">quite </a>a <a href="http://www.google.com/support/forum/p/gmail/thread?tid=00e43f845b2045d6&amp;hl=en">few</a> <a href="http://www.google.com/support/forum/p/Chrome/thread?tid=579d5b2939912968&amp;hl=en">people</a> <a href="http://www.google.com/support/forum/p/Chrome/thread?tid=7edb1b3753e0be40&amp;hl=en">with</a> <a href="http://www.google.com/support/forum/p/gmail/thread?tid=55345133bb303388&amp;hl=en">the</a> <a href="http://www.google.com/support/forum/p/Chrome/thread?tid=46ebd2f718483530&amp;hl=en">same</a> <a href="http://www.google.com/support/forum/p/gmail/thread?tid=21f7c5a346d7c348&amp;hl=en">problem</a>. But no real solutions other than “Switch to basic upload”, which is hardly a solution. A bit disappointing when a major feature of a Google product doesn’t work with Google’s flagship product!</p>

<p>I did however happen upon a solution myself. It turns out that it’s *somehow* related to the inbuilt flash plugin that comes with Chrome.<br />
 If you disable that, then install Flash, presto changeo, it works!</p>

<p>You can disable the plugin by typing</p>

<blockquote>
<p>chrome://plugins</p>
</blockquote>

<p>into the address bar and disabling it from there, but for administrators it’s probably easiest to use the following command line switch:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>-disable-internal-flash</p>
</blockquote>

<p>There’s probably a better solution, something that allows the inbuilt Flash plugin to work, but this was an improvement over the solutions posted on Google’s user-based tech support board!</p>

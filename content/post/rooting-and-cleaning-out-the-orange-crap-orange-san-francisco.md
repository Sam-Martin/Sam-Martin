# WARNING

Please check whether your phone is a G1 San Fran or a G2. You can do this by downloading [Ask Mr Pigfish](https://market.android.com/details?id=com.apedroid.pigfish "Ask Mr Pigfish") from the Android market.  
 If it’s a G2, following the instructions below will **brick your phone**. So don’t skip this part ok?


## The Rooting

I used [this excellent guide](http://android.modaco.com/content/zte-blade-blade-modaco-com/329073/21-mar-guide-how-to-install-a-custom-rom-on-the-zte-blade/ "San Francisco rom refresh.") to root and clean out my Orange San Francisco.

Basically it takes place in three parts:

1. [Unlock your San Â Francisco (Ridiculously easy)](http://android.modaco.com/content/zte-blade-blade-modaco-com/322848/free-sim-unlock-codes-for-orange-san-francisco-and-zte-blade/ "Unlock your San Francisco")
2. Root your San Francisco using Universal Androot (in the guide above).
3. Install a ROM using Clockwork via Recovery Manager

Now I got stuck at two points in this.

**Choosing a ROM  
**Personally I wanted Android 2.2 (FroYo), still, there were piles and piles on [Modaco’sÂ Â ROM list](http://android.modaco.com/content/zte-blade-roms-rom-customisation/329856/21-mar-roms-current-known-available-roms-for-the-zte-blade/ "Orange San Francisco ROM List"), so I simply went with the most popular one on [their poll](http://android.modaco.com/content/zte-blade-roms-rom-customisation/329997/poll-what-rom-are-you-using/ "Modaco's Orange San Francisco ROM Poll").

This was theÂ **[FLB-Froyo G2 for ZTE Blade (2.2)](http://android.modaco.com/content/zte-blade-roms-rom-customisation/323154/rom-oled-tft-flb-froyo-g2-for-zte-blade/ "Orange San Francisco FLB Froyo ROM").**

Once I’d picked a ROM, I just followed the instructions in the guide at the top and bingo, had a new FroYo install! But what’s this?

**Videos have a green line at the top!  
**After a bit of googling I found the solution [here](http://android.modaco.com/content/zte-blade-blade-modaco-com/324490/froyo-roms-youtube-hq-video-fix/ "Orange San Francisco FroYo Video Green Line Fix"), though it took me a while to figure out that in order to successfully edit/copy/rename anything in the system folder I had to

A) Rerun universal androot!

B) Go into the settings of ES File Explorer and enable superuser access.

Anyway, those few issues aside, I’m damned happy with this ridiculously good value phone!

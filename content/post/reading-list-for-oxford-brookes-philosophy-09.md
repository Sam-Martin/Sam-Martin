+++

I figured this was as good a place as any for me to post random crap about my first year of Philosophy at Brookes.  
 There are four modules in each semester of the first year, two core philosophy and two which can be anything you like.  
 I went with the basic setup of Philosophy, Religion and Politics, though I dare say I’ll switch Politics to Psychology at some point as it’s boring the tits off me so far.

My reading list for the semester is as follows:

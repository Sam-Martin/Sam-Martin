In my first Ops role I was blown away by my boss, who took the attitude of:

> If there's an incident of any kind, it is never any individual's fault, it is always the process' fault. If it's possible for someone to screw up enough to cause an outage, then the process is broken.  

Coming from an Internal IT background this was amazing to me, not only could I openly talk about the mistakes I made without risking being put on a disciplinary plan, I would have a group of people in the blameless post-mortem helping me figure out how to make it impossible for the same scenario to happen again.  
Reading books like The Phoenix Project cemented the idea, and blamelessness became part of my core values.  
My everyday thinking went from "ugh, why did x make y mistake" to "how do we build an environment in which x succeeds and flourishes?"

Trust, and emotional safety underpin pretty much everything in a well functioning team. You cannot pair program if you're scared to make typos. You can't save some-one time who's hunting down a bug you caused if you're afraid to admit you wrote bad code. Getting people to that place, especially those who have been in abusive work environments before, can take a huge amount of time, honesty, and personal vulnerability from the people who are trying to engender that ethos in the work environment. 

Setting a foot wrong in this regard is _unthinkable_. As hard as it is to gain, it's twice as easy as that to lose it. One snarky remark, one roll of the eyes and *poof* that trust is gone, the sharing evaporates, and everyone is back to being scared to admit that they made a mistake.

I see it as a personal failing when I have thoughts that run counter to this. When I'm frustrated with someone with a proven track record of negligence I'll always catch myself and repeat the mantra: "Don't blame the individual, blame the system which compels them to act this way."

I eventually realised, that the system that compelled them to act this way, was me.

# The feedback cycle

Kaizen, the concept of continuous improvement depends upon fast feedback cycles, so that people can see what works, fix what doesn't, and then get more feedback to start the cycle again.  
In the name of focussing on system improvements I had _completely_ hamstrung myself from being able to give feedback on areas of individual improvement.

I had confused _blame_ with responsibility and capability.

# The four tiers of blame

1. Whether it is your responsibility
2. Whether it is a reflection on your abilities
3. Whether it is an irredeemable lack of ability
4. Whether it makes you a bad person

## Level 1 - Responsibility

> You are the primary person responsible for ensuring that what happened, didn't happen

You are a trainee surgeon, your first surgery is going extremely well until an artery bursts and despite you and your attending's best efforts, the patient dies. You later relate your story to another experienced surgeon and they confirm that you did everything you could, sometimes these things just happen. Keeping the patient alive was your responsibility, but their death was not a reflection on your abilities.

## Level 2 - A reflection on your abilities

> You are the primary person responsible for ensuring this didn't happen, and it happened because of a lack of ability on your part.

Some months later as a trainee surgeon, you are overconfident in your skills and work too quickly, you make a mistake and your scalpal slips, nicking an artery, your attending swoops in and fixes it, saving the patient.  
You were responsible for ensuring you were working at an appropriate speed, within your capabilities, and it is a reflection upon your abilities as a surgeon that you didn't do that. It is not yet an irredeemable lack of ability, as this is the first time this has happened, and you have much training yet to complete.

## Level 3 - An irredeemable lack of ability

> You are the primary person responsible for ensuring this didn't happen, it happened because of a lack of ability on your part, it has happened before, and all avenues for personal improvement have been exhausted.

You are a resident surgeon, you've made the same mistake of nicking arteries hundreds of times, each time you've been sent back to work on your technique and consistency, but the mistake happens again, and again. Surgery is simply not a skill that it is within your ability to master and it is imperative that you cease practising before you kill someone.

## Level 4 - You are a bad person for letting this happen

> You are the primary person responsible for ensuring this didn't happen, it happened because of a lack of ability on your part, and you ignored the warning signs that serious consequences would occur if you did not remove yourself from this responsibility.

You are an attending surgeon, that mistake you made over and over again but always got away with has finally killed someone. You were not honest with yourself about your abilities, and instead of finding a speciality to which you were more suited, you have taken some-one's life through negligence.

# Negligence

> Negligence descibes a scenario when you had the opportunity to do the self-evidently right thing and elected not to, and that had a causal role in the negative outcome. 

Completely separate from the 4 tiers of blame is the concept of negligence.

## Self-evident

It's important that the 'right thing' was self-evident. If you get into a minor car accident that could have been avoided by leaving the house ten minutes earlier, that was not self-evident, and it is ludicrous to ascribe negligence to that descision.

## Causal role

It's important that the 'right thing' only _played a causal role_ rather than was the immediate cause of the negative outcome. If you intentionally elected not to put the brakes on a pram when letting go of it at the top of a steep hill that is malicious not negligent.


## Why this is important

It's important to understand what it means for something to be negligent as it helps us understand the appropriate action to take.
If an action was merely careless rather than negligent, the person responsible is probably beating themselves up about it already and your best action is probably to console them while working on addressing the systemic problem that allowed the outcome to occur.
If the action was clearly negligent, in addition to addressing the systemic problem that allowed the outcome to occur, you probably need to work with the individual to understand in detail what the circumstances surrounding it were, and potentially recommend training or mentoring to help them improve.
If the action was not negligent but actively _malicious_ your responsibility is to ensure the immediate safety of everyone involved and the removal of the malicious agent as quickly as possible.
